You can check the app running on [Heroku](http://sheltered-harbor-60080.herokuapp.com/)

*Note: In this project, EJS is rendering content server side, which I regret. You may notice some strange behavior when pages area loading. I'm planing to remove EJS and work with AngularJS routes instead, in a near future.*
